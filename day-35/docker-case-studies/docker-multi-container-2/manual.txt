Here's an enhanced example showcasing Docker networking with Flask, Streamlit, Redis, 
and Busybox in a machine learning context. This setup involves:

Flask: A backend API that serves predictions.
Streamlit: A frontend to input data and display predictions.
Redis: A message broker to store predictions temporarily.
Busybox: A lightweight container to showcase logging and model persistence via volumes.
Volumes: Used for persisting logs and a trained model file.


Steps to Run
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Train the model: Run worker/train_model.py locally or in the worker container to generate 
the model.pkl.

Start services:

docker-compose up --build
Access the frontend: Open http://localhost:8501.

View logs: 

Use Busybox to monitor logs:
docker logs busybox_logger


This setup demonstrates a fully-networked microservices architecture 
for a machine learning application with persistent logging and model storage.
