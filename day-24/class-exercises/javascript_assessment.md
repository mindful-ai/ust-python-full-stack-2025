# 🧩 JavaScript Assessment

### Instructions

Answer the following questions using JavaScript. Topics include numbers,
strings, arrays, and objects.\
Each question is designed to test your understanding of JavaScript
fundamentals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Questions**

1.  **Numbers:**\
    What will be the output of the following expression?

    ``` js
    console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3);
    ```

    Why?

2.  **Strings:**\
    Given

    ``` js
    let str = "Hello World";
    ```

    How do you replace `"World"` with `"JavaScript"` so that `str`
    becomes `"Hello JavaScript"`?

3.  **Arrays:**\
    Add `"yellow"` at the end of this array:

    ``` js
    let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
    ```

4.  **Arrays:**\
    Remove the **first element** from the array

    ``` js
    let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
    ```

    and store it in a variable called `firstFruit`.

5.  **Arrays (Tricky):**\
    Given

    ``` js
    let nums = [1, 2, 3];
    let newNums = nums;
    newNums.push(4);
    console.log(nums);
    ```

    What will be the output and why?

6.  **Strings (Tricky):**\
    Given

    ``` js
    let text = "JavaScript";
    ```

    Write a statement to get the last 3 characters (`"ipt"`) from the
    string.

7.  **Objects:**\
    Given

    ``` js
    let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
    ```

    Add a new key-value pair `"city": "Paris"` to the object.

8.  **Objects (Tricky):**\
    What will be the output of the following?

    ``` js
    let a = { name: "John" };
    let b = a;
    b.name = "Doe";
    console.log(a.name);
    ```

9.  **Arrays and Strings (Combination):**\
    Given

    ``` js
    let words = ["JavaScript", "is", "fun"];
    ```

    Convert this array into a single string `"JavaScript is fun"`.

10. **Numbers and Strings (Type Conversion):**\
    What will the following print?\
    `js     console.log("5" - 2);     console.log("5" + 2);`\
    Why are they different?
