Level order insertion is a method for adding a new node to a binary tree by finding the first available 
spot level by level, starting from the root. To do this, you use a queue to perform a breadth-first search (BFS), 
inserting the new node as the left or right child of the first node encountered that has an empty spot. 

The process continues until the new node is successfully inserted, ensuring the tree remains complete from left to right.  

How level order insertion works

    Initialize a queue: Create an empty queue and add the root node to it. 
    Iterate through the tree: While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node. 
    Check for an empty spot:
    If the dequeued node's left child is null, insert the new node there and stop. 
    Else, if the node's left child is not null, enqueue it.
    If the node's right child is null, insert the new node there and stop. 
    Else, if the node's right child is not null, enqueue it. 

Repeat: Continue this process until the new node has been inserted into an empty spot. 
This ensures that the tree is filled level by level from left to right, similar to how a heap is structured.
